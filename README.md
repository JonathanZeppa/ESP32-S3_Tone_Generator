# ESP32-S3_Tone_Generator

This simple tone generator allows you to dial a note with a rotary encoder, 
and play and stop the note with a momentary pushbutton. An OLED displays the note name. 
The note name and frequency are displayed in the serial monitor.

I'm using an and I2s DAC along with an ESP32-S3-DevKitM-1U.
